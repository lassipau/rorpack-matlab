Notes for the new feature "Frequency Estimating Robust Controller":

Add a new controller "paradigm", where the "missing" frequencies are estimated from the tracking error signal (as mentioned in the introduction of the AfsPau-manuscript".

In particular: 
 - The controller is first set up with an internal model of the _known_ frequencies (basically, 0 + the frequencies of yref). 
 - The controller is used for certain period of time T_0 during which error e(t) is analysed by a frequency estimator which extracts the frequencies of its non-decaying part. 
 - The time T_0 is either set explicitly, or (more challenging?) determined during the simulation based on the changes of the estimated frequencies and a tolerance parameter etc. 
 

General comments and properties:
 - This could be a "controller platform" in the sense that it can use any IM-based controller as the main controller structure (just by calling the implemented routines).
 - This probably requires a parallel implementation for simulating the CL-system (which then also includes the simulation of the frequency estimator, if it is of a dynamic type). 
 - Could consider if there are some parameters which do not need to be recomputed in the controllers when the IM is changed (e.g., the estimator parts L in LQG etc)
 - Could add different frequency estimator types, e.g., the ones that are already implemented, by CarAst08, VedVed20arxiv), as well as FFT.
